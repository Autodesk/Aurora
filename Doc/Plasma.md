# Plasma

**Plasma** is a small reference application used to exercise Aurora, without requiring the use of a full Autodesk application or USD Hydra scene delegate. Plasma can load OBJ files like the one shown below, along with certain material properties. See the usage instructions below. The [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data) is a good resource for OBJ files.

## System Requirements

Plasma has the same [system requirements](../README.md) as Aurora. In particular, a GPU with support for DirectX Raytracing or Vulkan Ray Tracing is required.

At this time, interactive use of Plasma is only supported on Windows. For Linux, command-line single image rendering is available as described below, and interactive support is coming soon.

\* This is a performance optimization.

** It may be necessary to increase trace depth for overlapping transparent / transmissive surfaces, at the cost of performance.

## Command Line Rendering
The following command renders an output image with the specified scene file. The optional `--renderer hgi` argument enables the HGI backend in the renderer, with DirectX used as the default backend. On Linux, you must use the HGI backend.
```
Plasma --output {OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.png} --scene {INPUT_SCENE.obj} [--renderer hgi]
```

## OBJ Material Properties in Plasma

The following properties from OBJ MTL files are supported. OBJ MTL properties not listed here are ignored. Materials are converted to use the [Autodesk Standard Surface](https://autodesk.github.io/standard-surface) material model.

| Standard Surface   | OBJ MTL File | Notes                                                        |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| base_color         | Kd / map_Kd  | Image supported.                                             |
| metalness          | Pm           |                                                              |
| specular_color     | Ks           |                                                              |
| specular_roughness | Pr / map_Pr  | Image supported.<br /><br />"Ns" for non-physical shininess is not supported; use Pr instead. |
| specular_IOR       | Ni           | This is the index of refraction, e.g. 1.5 is a good value for glass. |
| transmission       | Tr / d       | The two values are inverses of each of other, i.e. *d* of 1 is the same as *Tr* of 0, i.e. opaque. It may be necessary to increase the trace depth (described above) for certain models to look correct.<br /><br /> *Tr / d* in OBJ are typically used for opacity (transparency) but here they are used for *transmission* instead, which is more interesting, e.g. for refraction. If values for both are present, the value for *d* will be used. |
| transmission_color | Tf           | Black (the default) is assumed to be useless and will be interpreted as white (no tint). |
| opacity            | map_d        | Image only.<br /><br />This is different from *transmission*. In Standard Surface, opacity refers to *transparency*, which is simple alpha blending. It was determined that it is more useful for *map_d* to be used for opacity, to support cutouts. |
| normal             | bump / norm  | Image only, and it must be a normal map (not a height map)   |
